# IMDB Titles Scraper By Company

This actor allows you to scrape titles from IMDB that created or disturbed by a specific company. All you need to do in 
order to start the scraper is to get the company id which is the main input "for now" in the scraper.

## Input configuration

The actor has the following input options:

- **Company ID** - Paste the company id you get from IMDB into this field.
- **Testing** - Optionally, select yes to scrape only the first 50 movies.
- **Proxy** - Optionally, select a proxy to be used by the actor,
  in order to avoid IP address-based blocking by the target website.
  The actor automatically executes all the Scrapy's HTTP(S) requests through the proxy.
